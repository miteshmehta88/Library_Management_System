LOGGING INTEGRATION SUMMARY

The Library Management System has been updated to use Python's logging module instead of print statements.

CHANGES MADE:

1. LIBRARY.PY
   - Added: import logging and logger initialization
   - Replaced print() with logger.info() in:
     * display_books()
     * display_members()
     * issue_book()
     * return_book()

2. MEMBER.PY
   - Added: import logging and logger initialization
   - Replaced print() with logger.info() in:
     * borrow_book()
     * return_book()

3. MAIN.PY
   - Added: import logging
   - Added logging configuration:
     * Level: INFO
     * Format: '%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
     * Handlers: FileHandler (library_management.log) and StreamHandler (console)
   - Replaced print() with logger.info() in all display functions:
     * create_sample_data_and_operations()
     * display_issued_books()
     * display_available_books()
     * display_available_books_by_genre()
     * search_books_by_keyword()
     * display_members_with_borrowed_books()
     * display_books_count_by_genre()
     * display_books_count_by_genre_by_issuance()
     * display_most_popular_genre_from_issued_books()

4. .GITIGNORE
   - Added: *.log pattern to exclude all log files from git tracking

LOGGING CONFIGURATION:
- Level: INFO (logs all INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages)
- Output: Both file (library_management.log) and console
- Format: Timestamp - Logger Name - Level - Message

LOG FILE:
- Location: library_management.log (created automatically in the project directory)
- Size: Grows with each run
- Management: Can be safely deleted as it's ignored by git

USAGE:
- Run the application as before: python main.py
- Logs will be displayed in the console
- All logs are saved to library_management.log for review
- Log file is not tracked by git (.gitignore excludes *.log)

BENEFITS:
1. Structured logging with timestamps
2. Logger name identification (which module generated the log)
3. Log level management (can easily change to DEBUG, WARNING, etc.)
4. File persistence for audit and debugging
5. Clean separation of logs from version control
