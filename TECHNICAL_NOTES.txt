LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - TECHNICAL NOTES

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
The system follows an object-oriented design with three primary classes:
- Book: Represents library inventory items with metadata and availability tracking
- Member: Represents library patrons with borrowing capabilities and limits
- Library: Central manager coordinating book and member operations

CORE DESIGN PATTERNS
1. State Management: Book objects maintain is_available boolean state
2. Collection Management: Library maintains separate lists for books and members
3. Validation: Operations validate constraints before execution (5-book limit, availability checks)
4. Search: Linear search implementation for book lookup by keyword

KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Book Class:
- Immutable metadata (id, title, author, genre)
- Mutable state (is_available flag)
- Methods: borrow() sets is_available=False, return_book() sets is_available=True
- String representation includes current availability status

Member Class:
- Fixed attributes (id, name, age, contact_info)
- Dynamic borrowed_books list (max 5 items)
- borrow_book() validates: member has space AND book is available
- return_book() validates: book exists in member's borrowed list

Library Class:
- Maintains two collections: books list and members list
- issue_book() combines Book.borrow() + Member.borrow_book()
- return_book() combines Member.return_book() + Book.return_book()
- available_books() filters books by is_available, supports optional genre filter
- search_book() performs case-insensitive substring matching on title/author
- most_popular_genre_from_issued_books() counts genres of unavailable books

CONSTRAINTS & BUSINESS RULES
- Maximum 5 books per member simultaneously
- Books cannot be borrowed if is_available=False
- Members cannot return books they didn't borrow
- Genre filtering requires exact genre match

OPERATIONAL FLOW
1. Create library instance
2. Add books and members to library
3. issue_book() transfers book between states and updates member list
4. return_book() reverses the process
5. Query operations (available_books, search_book) provide read-only access

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- add/remove operations: O(n) for lists
- search_book: O(n) linear search
- available_books: O(n) with optional O(1) genre comparison
- most_popular_genre: O(n) with genre counting

SAMPLE DATA
21 books across genres: Fiction, Dystopian, Fantasy, Adventure, Thriller, Mystery, Literature
7 registered members with varying borrowing activity
Demo issues 12 books and returns 4, demonstrating full operation lifecycle

STATUS: Production-ready demonstration system with sample data and error handling
