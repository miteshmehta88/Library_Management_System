TRY-CATCH ERROR HANDLING IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

OBJECTIVE:
Added comprehensive try-catch (try-except) blocks to handle errors gracefully throughout the Library Management System.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. BOOK.PY - Input Validation
   - Book.__init__(): Validates all parameters
     * book_id: Must be positive integer
     * title: Must be non-empty string
     * author: Must be non-empty string
     * genre: Must be non-empty string
   - Exceptions caught:
     * ValueError: Invalid parameter types or values
     * General Exception: Unexpected errors with detailed logging

2. MEMBER.PY - Input Validation & Operations
   - Member.__init__(): Validates all parameters
     * member_id: Must be positive integer
     * name: Must be non-empty string
     * age: Must be non-negative integer
     * contact_info: Must be non-empty string
   - Member.borrow_book(): Validates book object
     * Checks for required methods/attributes
     * Catches AttributeError if book is invalid
     * Logs errors and continues gracefully
   - Member.return_book(): Validates book object
     * Checks for required methods/attributes
     * Catches AttributeError if book is invalid
     * Logs errors and continues gracefully
   - Exceptions caught:
     * ValueError: Invalid parameters
     * AttributeError: Missing required book methods
     * General Exception: Unexpected errors with logging

3. LIBRARY.PY - Object Validation & Operations
   - Library.add_book(): Validates book object
     * Checks for book_id attribute
     * Catches TypeError for invalid objects
     * Logs operations at debug level
   - Library.add_member(): Validates member object
     * Checks for member_id attribute
     * Catches TypeError for invalid objects
     * Logs operations at debug level
   - Library.issue_book(): Validates book and member
     * Checks for required attributes
     * Catches TypeError for invalid objects
     * Logs errors and continues safely
   - Library.return_book(): Validates member object
     * Checks for required attributes
     * Catches TypeError for invalid objects
     * Logs errors and continues safely
   - Library.search_books(): Input validation
     * Validates keyword parameter (non-empty string)
     * Catches ValueError for invalid input
     * Returns empty list on error instead of raising
   - Exceptions caught:
     * TypeError: Invalid object types
     * ValueError: Invalid parameters
     * General Exception: Unexpected errors with logging

4. MAIN.PY - Configuration & Execution
   - Logging configuration: Protected with try-except
     * Catches IOError if log file cannot be created
     * Catches general exceptions during setup
     * Allows meaningful error messages
   - main() function: Comprehensive error handling
     * Wraps entire execution flow
     * Logs start and completion messages
     * Catches all exceptions with stack trace (exc_info=True)
     * Re-raises critical errors for proper exit codes

ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:

1. INPUT VALIDATION (Book, Member)
   - Validates on object creation
   - Raises meaningful ValueError with context
   - Prevents invalid objects from entering system

2. OPERATIONAL VALIDATION (Library methods)
   - Validates object types before operations
   - Catches TypeError for type mismatches
   - Logs errors and continues gracefully

3. EXECUTION PROTECTION (main)
   - Wraps entire execution in try-except
   - Logs detailed error information
   - Includes stack traces for debugging

LOGGING LEVELS USED:
- logger.info(): Normal operations and messages
- logger.debug(): Object additions (books/members)
- logger.error(): Caught exceptions with context

BENEFITS:
✓ Prevents invalid data from entering the system
✓ Graceful error recovery without crashes
✓ Detailed error logging for debugging
✓ Type safety through validation
✓ Meaningful error messages
✓ System continues functioning even if individual operations fail
✓ Stack traces available for unexpected errors

TESTING RESULTS:
✓ System runs successfully with no exceptions
✓ Invalid Book creation properly caught and logged
✓ Invalid Member creation properly caught and logged
✓ Valid objects create successfully
✓ All operations complete with exit code 0
✓ Error messages are informative and logged

EXAMPLE ERROR HANDLING:
- Creating Book(-1, 'Test', 'Author', 'Fiction')
  → Caught: ValueError - "book_id must be a positive integer"
  
- Creating Member(0, '', 25, 'email@test.com')
  → Caught: ValueError - "member_id must be a positive integer"
  
- Searching with empty keyword
  → Caught: ValueError - Returns empty list instead of crashing
